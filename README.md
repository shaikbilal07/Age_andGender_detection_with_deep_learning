# Age_andGender_detection_with_deep_learning

This project uses deep learning to predict the age and gender of a person from an input image. It employs a pre-trained deep neural network to analyze facial features and provides predictions for the approximate age range and gender.
Introduction
Age and Gender Detection is a popular computer vision application that helps to estimate a personâ€™s age and gender based on facial features. This project uses deep learning techniques, leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification. It can be used in various applications such as demographic analysis, targeted marketing, or for other statistical insights.

Dataset
The model is trained on a public dataset containing images labeled with age and gender information. UTKFace is one example of a dataset that contains over 20,000 images with labels for age and gender. Ensure you have the appropriate license to use any dataset you download.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
You can install the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Age_andGender_Detection.git
cd Age_andGender_Detection
Install dependencies (as listed above).

Download the dataset and place it in a directory named data.

Usage
Training the Model: You can train the model on the dataset by running:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Make sure to set the paths to the dataset and model parameters in the code as needed.

Predicting Age and Gender: To make predictions on a single image, run:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
This will output the predicted age range and gender.

Using the Webcam for Real-time Detection: You can also use your webcam for real-time age and gender detection:

bash
Copy code
python webcam.py
Results
The model achieves approximately X% accuracy for gender detection and Y% mean absolute error (MAE) for age prediction. Sample results are shown below:
