# Age_andGender_detection_with_deep_learning

This project uses deep learning to predict the age and gender of a person from an input image. It employs a pre-trained deep neural network to analyze facial features and provides predictions for the approximate age range and gender.

Introduction
Age and Gender Detection is a popular computer vision application that helps to estimate a personâ€™s age and gender based on facial features. This project uses deep learning techniques, leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification. It can be used in various applications such as demographic analysis, targeted marketing, or for other statistical insights.

Dataset
The model is trained on a public dataset containing images labeled with age and gender information. UTKFace is one example of a dataset that contains over 20,000 images with labels for age and gender. Ensure you have the appropriate license to use any dataset you download.

Results
The model achieves approximately X% accuracy for gender detection and Y% mean absolute error (MAE) for age prediction. Sample results are shown below:
